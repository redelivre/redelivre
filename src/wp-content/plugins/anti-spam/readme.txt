**Why humans should prove that they are humans by filling captchas? Lets bots prove that they are not bots with adding javascript to their user-agents!**

Anti-spam plugin blocks spam in comments automatically, invisibly for users and for admins.

* **no captcha**, because spam is not users' problem
* **no moderation queues**, because spam is not administrators' problem
* **no settings page**, because it is great to forget about spam completely and keep admin section clean


Plugin is easy to use: just install it and it just works.

**Plugin blocks spam only in comments section**.

After installing the Anti-spam plugin **try to submit a comment on your site being logged out**.
If you get an error - you may check the solution in the [Support section](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/anti-spam) or submit a new topic with detailed description of your problem.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the percentage of spam blocked? =

Anti-spam plugin blocks 100% of automatic spam messages (sent by spam-bots via post requests).
Plugin does not block manual spam (submitted by spammers manually via browser).
You can use [Anti-spam Pro](http://codecanyon.net/item/antispam-pro/6491169?ref=webvitalii "Upgrade to Pro") plugin if you need to block manual spam.

= Incompatible with: =

* Disqus
* Jetpack Comments
* AJAX Comment Form
* bbPress

= How does Anti-spam plugin work? =

The blocking algorithm is based on 2 methods: 'invisible js-captcha' and 'invisible input trap' (aka honeypot technique).

= How does 'invisible js-captcha' method (aka honeypot) work? =

The 'invisible js-captcha' method is based on fact that bots does not have javascript on their user-agents.
Extra hidden field is added to comments form.
It is the question about the current year.
If the user visits site, than this field is answered automatically with javascript, is hidden by javascript and css and invisible for the user.
If the spammer will fill year-field incorrectly - the comment will be blocked because it is spam.

= How does 'invisible input trap' (aka honeypot technique) method work? =

The 'invisible input trap' method is based on fact that almost all the bots will fill inputs with name 'email' or 'url'.
Extra hidden field is added to comments form.
This field is hidden for the user and user will not fill it.
But this field is visible for the spammer.
If the spammer will fill this trap-field with anything - the comment will be blocked because it is spam.

= How to know the counter of blocked spam comments? =

You can find the info block with total spam blocked counter in the admin comments section.
You can hide or show this info block in the "Screen Options" section.
The visibility option for this info block is saved per user.

= How to test what spam comments were blocked? =

You may enable sending all rejected spam comments to admin email.
Edit [anti-spam.php](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/anti-spam/trunk/anti-spam.php) file and find "$antispam_send_spam_comment_to_admin" and make it "true".
Or you may log all blocked spam comments to log files.
Edit [anti-spam.php](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/anti-spam/trunk/anti-spam.php) file and find "$antispam_log_spam_comment" and make it "true".
Spam comments will be saved in the file: http://site.com/wp-content/plugins/anti-spam/log/anti-spam-2015-12.log (where "site.com" is the domain and "2015-12" is year and month).
Spam log is stored in files per month and history will be saved for 1 year and older log files will be deleted automatically.
These features are made for debug purposes and values for these flags will be overwritten after plugin's update.
These features are disabled by default.

= Does plugin block spam from Contact or other forms? =

Plugin blocks spam only in comments form section and does not block spam from any other forms on site.
If you installed and activated the plugin and you still receiving spam - probably this could be because of some other forms on your site (for example comments forms).

= What about trackback spam? =

Users rarely use trackbacks because it is manual and requires extra input. Spammers uses trackbacks because it is easy to cheat here.
Users use pingbacks very often because they work automatically. Spammers does not use pingbacks because backlinks are checked.
So trackbacks are blocked by default but pingbacks are enabled. You may enable trackbacks if you use it.
Edit [anti-spam.php](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/anti-spam/trunk/anti-spam.php) file and find "$antispam_allow_trackbacks" and make it "true".
You may read more about the [difference between trackbacks and pingbacks](http://web-profile.com.ua/web/trackback-vs-pingback/).

= What browsers are supported? =

All modern browsers and IE8+ are supported.

= Unobtrusive JavaScript =

Anti-spam plugin works with disabled JavaScript. JavaScript is disabled on less than 1% of devices.
Users with disabled JavaScript should manually fill catcha-like input before submitting the comment.

= And one more extra note... =

If site has caching plugin enabled and cache is not cleared or if theme does not use 'comment_form' action
and there is no plugin inputs in comments form - plugin tries to add hidden fields automatically using JavaScript.

= Not enough information about the plugin? =

You may check out the [source code of the plugin](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/anti-spam/trunk/anti-spam.php).
The plugin is pretty small and easy to read.
