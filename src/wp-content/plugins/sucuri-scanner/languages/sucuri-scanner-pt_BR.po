You should not worry about this option unless you know what a reverse proxy is. Services like the <a href=\"https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/\" target=\"_blank\">Sucuri Firewall</a> &mdash; once active &mdash; forces the network traffic to pass through them to filter any security threat that may affect the original server. A side effect of this is that the real IP address is no longer available in the global server variable <em>REMOTE-ADDR</em> but in a custom HTTP header with a name provided by the service."

msgid "APIKeyHelp"

msgid "AvailableUpdatesInfo"
msgstr "WordPress has a big user base in the public Internet, this brings interest to malicious people to find vulnerabilities in the code, 3rd-party extensions, and themes that other companies develop. You should keep every piece of code installed in your website update to prevent attacks as soon as disclosed vulnerabilities are patched."

msgid "WhitelistScript"
msgstr "Whitelist Blocked PHP Files"

msgid "WhitelistScriptInfo"
msgstr "After you apply the hardening in either the includes, content, and/or upload directories the plugin will add a rule in the access control file to deny access to any PHP file located in these folders, this is a good precaution in case that an attacker is able to upload a shell script; with a few exceptions the <em>\"index.php\"</em> is the only one that should be publicly accessible, however many theme/plugin developers decide to use these folders to process some operations, in this case applying the hardening <strong>may break</strong> their functionality."

msgid "Uninstall"
msgstr "Reset Security Logs, Hardening and Settings"

msgid "UninstallInfo"
msgstr "This action will trigger the deactivation / uninstallation process of the plugin. All local security logs, hardening and settings will be deleted.

msgid "ImportExportInfo"
msgstr "Copy the JSON-encoded data from the box below, go to your other websites and click the <em>\"Import\"</em> button in the settings page. The plugin will start using the same settings from this website. Notice that some options are omitted as they contain values specific to this website. To import the settings from another website into this one, replace the JSON-encoded data in the box below with the JSON-encoded data exported from the other website, then click the button <em>\"Import\"</em>. Notice that some options will not be imported to reduce the security risk of writing arbitrary data into the disk."

msgstr "Data Storage"

msgid "DataStorageInfo"
msgstr "This is the directory where the plugin will store the security logs, the list of files marked as fixed in the core integrity tool, the cache for the malware scanner and 3rd-party plugin metadata. The plugin requires write permissions in this directory as well as the files contained in it. If you prefer to keep these files in a non-public directory <em>(one level up the document root) </em> please define a constant in the <em>\"wp-config.php\"</em> file named <em>\"SUCURI_DATA_STORAGE\"</em> with the absolute path to the new directory."

msgstr "The data used to generate these charts comes from the last <b>%%SUCURI.AuditReport.Logs4Report%% audit logs</b>, you can configure this number from the plugin settings page."

msgid "LogsReportDescription"
msgstr "Enabling this option allows you to have a quick view of the range of the activity of your users and/or the attacks directed against your website. By default, the plugin uses the latest entries in the audit logs and uses that information to draw bar and pie charts in the dashboard. The statistic are generated with a limited number of logs to reduce the memory consumption of the parser. You can increase the limit at your own discretion considering the amount of memory and maximum execution time that your PHP installation is allowed to use."
