Integrates the Events Manager and WPML plugins together to provide a smoother multilingual experience (Requires Events Manager and WPML)

== Description ==

This plugin helps make [Events Manager](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/events-manager/) and [WPML](http://wpml.org) work better together by improving various issues:

* Detects translated pages of specific EM pages (assigned in Events > Settings > Pages) and displays relevant language content
* Event translations now share relevant information across all translations, including
 * Event Times
 * Location Information
  * If translations for the location exist, translated events will show/link to location of the same language, if not the original location translation.
 * Bookings and Booking Forms
 * If you delete an event that is the originally translated event, booking and other meta info is transferred to default language or next available language translation.
* Custom texts, emails and formats can now be customized for each language in the settings page.
 
Requires Events Manager 5.6 or higher

= Special Installation Steps =
Please ensure that WPML 3 and EM 5.6 or higher are installed BEFORE activating this plugin.

When setting up EM and WPML, you should create translated versions of the event, location, category, tag, etc. pages assigned in Events > Settings > Pages of your admin area. Duplicating them using WPML is enough.
 
= Nuances = 
WPML and Events Manager are both very complex plugins and there are some inevitable nuances and features that currently won't work and more time is needed to find appropriate solutions:

* Pro Booking forms currently aren't translatable yet, planned for version 1.1
* Pro event booking reminders aren't translated correctly, planned for version 1.1
* Certain placeholders that output extra static text (such as #_BOOKINGSUMMARY outputting price 'Total') aren't fully translated.
* Recurring events
 * Recurring Events can't be translated when editing the recurrence template, they must be done one by one i.e. at single event level
 * Recurring events are disabled by default due to the above
* Location Searching
 * currently autocompleter forces searches for current languages, we may want to change this in the future to search all languages but give precedence to showing the translated version if available
* MultiSite
 * Event Manager's MultiSite Global Tables Mode will not work as expected, listing events and locations from other sites will not return the correct items (if at all). This is due to the architecture of WPML vs. EM when in Global Tables Mode. 
 
Given the flexibiltiy of both plugins, there is an huge number of possible setting/language combinations to test. Please let us know of any other nuances you come across on your setup and we'll do our best to fix them as time permits.
