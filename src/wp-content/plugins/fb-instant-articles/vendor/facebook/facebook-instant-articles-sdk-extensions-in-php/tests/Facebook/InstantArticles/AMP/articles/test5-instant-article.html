        Both expressions seems correct and in common shares the requisite of
        <a href="http://blog.wod.expert/2016/05/01/breaking-parallel-line">breaking parallel line</a>
        while squatting. Just for correctness, the Wall Ball Shot is the best title to use.
      </p>
      <p>One thing that comes to mind is that when thinking about wall ball It reminds me of only one constraint to make it a valid movement. So if you throw the ball below the limit line it is a “no-rep”, otherwise +1 to your reps. &#x1f609;</p>
      <p>Looking to the wall ball shot perspective, not only the bottom limit is important, but also there is a top, left and right limits. In other words: you gotta hit the target.</p>

      <p>CrossFit isn’t just about being strong and fast, but also precise. Always consider yourself doing your wall balls hitting at same target always. If you compete into any fitness competition, the odds of using a ball shot exercise increases, since the ball shot are easier equipment to have on open spaces. The wall, save for your box &#x1f609;</p>
      <h2>Hints for the exercise</h2>
      <p>Never stop looking at your target, the piece of metal, circle, line or the imaginary “X” mark on the wall. This will make your body foresee where you need to hit, and just throw there, you’ll gonna hit it!</p>
      <p>
        Never forget to break the parallel, and while going down, don’t try to slow your descent, this will make you burn your muscles. Always remember, if you want to perform better on the WODs
        <a href="http://blog.wod.expert/2016/06/06/always-save-energy">always think about saving energy</a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Thinking about doing the wallball shots, never forget to use all your body as lever to accomplish the movement with the minimal effort possible. By this I mean:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start movement by performing a “deadlift”getting the ball from floor</li>
        <li>Go down as fast as you can, holding the ball at your face level, holding by the bottom of the ball</li>
        <li>Break the parallel and then explode as fast as you can your legs</li>
        <li>By the moment you are straight up, your ball will move up without any force</li>
        <li>Push the ball up, like setting a volleyball ball, never forgetting to use your wrists, this will save some shoulders and legs energy</li>
        <li>You HIT the target! Add one to your counting sequence, never forget this &#x1f609; !</li>
        <li>If your counting comes to the correct number, jump to number 11.</li>
        <li>The ball will start to descend, keep your arms straight up waiting for the contact</li>
        <li>Absorb the ball with your arms and wrists and start the descend, using the less amount of energy possible</li>
        <li>Repeat from step 2!</li>
        <li>You are done!</li>
      </ol>

        <li>Perform some sets of walking lunges</li>
