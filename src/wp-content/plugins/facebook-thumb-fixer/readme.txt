Fixes the problem of the missing (or wrong) thumbnail when a post is shared on Facebook.

== Description ==

This plug-in is for those who have the problem where sharing a post on Facebook shows the wrong (or no) thumbnail image.

It works by making sure the thumbnail is derived from the featured image of your post. If your post doesn't have a featured image then it will use a fall-back image that you can specify.

The plug-in inserts the open graph meta properties, which Facebook and other social services look for when someone shares your page. These properties contain information about the page and of course the image you specify.

== Installation ==

Install, activate, done.

== Uninstall ==

Deactivate the plugin, delete if desired.

== Official Web Site (and support) ==

<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/facebook-thumb-fixer">Facebook Thumb Fixer Support</a> at the official Wordpress repository.

Go to 'Facebook Thumb Fixer' in WordPress admin for more information about how it works, what it does, and how to resolve common problems.

== How to set a fall-back image ==

Go to Settings -> General and scroll down until you find 'Default Facebook Thumb'. Put the path to your fall-back image there. Make sure it's at least 1200x630 or 600x315.

== How to set a Facebook App ID ==

If you have a Facebook App, you can get the App ID from <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/apps/" target="_blank">your developer dashboard</a>.

Specify your Facebook App ID Settings -> General.

== How to set an object type ==

<strong>Posts and Pages</strong>

On each page or post you edit there is an 'Open Graph Object Type' meta box. Simply make a section from there to specify what Object Type the page or post is. Example: If the it's an article, then choose 'article'. If it's a product, choose 'product'. To help you decide what Object Type to choose, go <a href-"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/opengraph" target="_blank">here</a> to learn the differences between them all.

Note: If no selection is made for posts or pages then the Object Type will be 'article', which in most cases is fine.

<strong>Home page</strong>

To specify what Object Type your homepage is, go to the Wordpress Settings -> General page and make a selection from the 'Home page Object Type' field.

Note: If no selection is made for the home page then the Object Type will be 'webpage', which in most cases is probably what you want.
