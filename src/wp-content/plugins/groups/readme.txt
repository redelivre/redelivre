Groups is an efficient and powerful solution, providing group-based user membership management, group-based capabilities and content access control.

== Description ==

Groups is designed as an efficient, powerful and flexible solution for group-oriented memberships and content access control.

It provides group-based user membership management, group-based capabilities and access control for content, built on solid principles.

Groups is light-weight and offers an easy user interface, while it acts as a framework and integrates standard WordPress capabilities and application-specific capabilities along with an extensive API.

Enhanced functionality is available via [Official Extensions](http://www.itthinx.com/product-category/groups/) for Groups.

== Installation ==

1. Upload or extract the `groups` folder to your site's `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. You can also use the *Add new* option found in the *Plugins* menu in WordPress.  
2. Enable the plugin from the *Plugins* menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the documentation? =

The official documentation is located at the [Groups Documentation](http://docs.itthinx.com/document/groups/) pages.

= I have a question, where do I ask? =

For questions directly related to Groups, you can leave a comment at the [Groups Plugin](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/groups/) page.

= How do I restrict access to a post? =

Let's assume you want members of the *Premium* group to be able to view some restricted posts.

- If you want to create a new protected post, simply go to *Posts > Add New* as usual and in the _Groups_ box input *Premium* in the _Read_ field. Save or publish your post.
- If you want to protect an existing post you can simply edit it, input *Premium* in the _Read_ field of the _Groups_ box and update the post.

In both cases, it doesn't matter if the *Premium* group already exists or not, if it doesn't, it will be created automatically.

If the *Premium* group already exists and you want to protect one or more existing posts in bulk, go to *Posts*, select all posts you want to protect and choose *Edit* in the *Bulk Actions* dropdown.
Now click *Apply*, select the *Premium* group and click *Update*.

After you publish or update your posts, only members of the *Premium* group will be able to see them.

= I want Advanced and Premium members, where the Premium members can access everything that Advanced members can access. How can I do that? =

Example: Advanced and Premium members

1. Go to *Groups > Groups > New Group* and add two new  groups, let's call them *Advanced* and *Premium* - select *Advanced* as the *Parent* for the *Premium* group.
2. Now create an example post that only members of the *Advanced* group should be able to access and choose the *Advanced* group in the _Read_ field of the _Groups_ box.
3. Create another post for members of the *Premium* group and choose the *Premium* group for that post.
4. Assign test users to both groups, log in as each user in turn and see which posts will be accessible.

= How do I limit access to posts so that users in group A can not read the same as those in group B and vice-versa? =

Example: Green and Red members

1. Go to *Groups > Groups > New Group* and add two new groups, let's call them *Green Members* and *Red Members*
2. Now create an example post that only members of the *Green Members* group should be able to see and choose the *Green Members* group in the _Groups_ box.
3. Create another post for *Red Members* and choose the *Red Members* group for that post.
4. Assign a test user to each of the groups, log in as one of them and you will see that the member of the *Green Members* group will only have access to the post protected by that group but not to the post protected with the *Red Members* group and vice-versa.

= Are access restrictions for Custom Post Types (CPT) supported? =

Yes. Access restrictions can be turned on or off for specific CPTs on the *Groups > Options* page.

= How can I show groups that users belong to on their profile page in the admin section? =

Go to *Groups > Options* and enable the option under *User profiles*.

= Developers ... aka ... What about Groups' API? =

The Groups plugin provides an extensive framework to handle memberships, group-based capabilities and access control.

The API documentation is available here: [Groups API](http://api.itthinx.com/groups).
