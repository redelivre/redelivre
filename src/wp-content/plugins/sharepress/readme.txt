Automatic posting and reposting to Facebook and Twitter.

== Description ==

[SharePress](https://getsharepress.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=app-store&utm_campaign=sharepress) is a WordPress plugin that automatically shares your content to Facebook and Twitter.
Support for LinkedIn, and more goodies are coming in [version 3.0](https://getsharepress.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=app-store&utm_campaign=version-3.0). 

Features include:

* Automatically publish your WordPress posts to your personal Facebook wall

Upgrade to the Pro version for e-mail based support directly from the developers and access to these features:

* Publish to all of the Facebook pages you manage
* Publish to your Twitter followers
* Customize each Facebook status message
* Control the image Facebook uses just by setting the post's featured image
* Customize Twitter status hashtag
* Delay SharePress' sharing for minutes, hours, or days after a post goes live
* Schedule reposts of your content: keep traffic flowing to your site day and night
* Total control over all Facebook open graph meta data using filters and/or custom fields

SharePress is compatible with WordPress Multisite (MU) and WordPress Multi-Network.

= Why use SharePress instead of those other guys? =
Three great reasons:

**Focus** Integrating with social networks is hard, so we focus on the big providers - Facebook and Twitter, and soon
Google+ and LinkedIn, too - so that SharePress can continue to be the most reliable solution for automatic
posting and reposting. You write good content, and we'll keep the oauth out of your hair.

**Ease of use** Simple is hard, but we're committed to keeping SharePress easy to use. Like WordPress' core features, we'll 
always try to keep our defaults sensible, and our options pages short. This ensures SharePress is easy to 
use for you, your clients and customers, and also keeps SharePress healthy and easy to maintain.

**Support** SharePress is [supported software](https://getsharepress.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=app-store&utm_campaign=get-support).
Having trouble setting up your Facebook or Twitter application? No problem, we've got your back.
Something not working the way you expect? We're an e-mail away, and we often respond on the first day.

But don't take our word for it...

= Who uses SharePress? =

Awesome people like these:

Mike Schepker of <a href="http://letstalkabout.tv" target="_blank">letstalkabout.tv</a> says

> SharePress is the easiest, most reliable plugin for getting your WordPress content onto your Facebook page. Setup was a breeze and I have not experienced any issues with the new plugin. SharePress is a much more elegant solution than other services like Networked Blogs. SharePress was the first premium plugin I've ever purchased for my site, and let me tell you, it was well worth the money. 

Corey Brown of <a href="http://www.notreble.com">No Treble</a> and <a href="http://www.squidoo.com">Squidoo</a> says

> I've been a lucky beta tester for SharePress for about 6 months now. Not only is it completely reliable, the feature set is second to none. I'd been trying to solve the WordPress-to-Facebook page issue for quite some time, and SharePress stands alone with its feature list. This is a game changing plugin (have you seen the repost feature!?). And if that wasn't enough, this one has the best support I've ever seen from a plugin developer.

Tim Stephenson of [holistic-care.com](http://www.holistic-care.com) says

> Firstly, thanks for creating SharePress - it's the first plugin for social "cross posting" I've come across that actually just works, and more importantly, works reliably every time you use it!

David Delaney of [whiskeyboys.com](http://www.whiskeyboys.com) says

> "I'm all set now. Thank you very much for your help and for this awesome plugin."

Dan Winer of [danatdisney.com](http://danatdisney.com) says

> I can't tell you how many Facebook plugins I have tried and none of them have been reliable enough, simple enough or flexible enough for simply posting new posts to a Facebook Page. Finally I have found SharePress - simple, reliable, flexible, (cheap) - Thank you so much Fat Panda! If only I had found you earlier.

Jason Hess of <a href="http://www.RV7-Factory.com" target="_blank">RV7-Factory.com</a> says

> SharePress is exactly what I needed to keep all my followers and fellow enthusiasts up-to-date with the greatest of ease. Why post twice when SharePress does all the work for you!? You can't beat the support either!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I post to the wall of my Facebook page? =

You need the Pro version. All you have to do is [buy a key](https://getsharepress.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=app-store&utm_campaign=post-to-page).

= Why do I need to pay for posting to my Facebook page? =

SharePress' features are without parallel. Being able to post automatically to your Facebook page is only the beginning. The reposting feature is the one that has the potential to bring the most traffic growth to your site.

Plus, Facebook is a very difficult platform the work with - their motto is, "Move fast and break things." No joke. When you pay for SharePress you are paying for Fat Panda to constantly monitor and maintain this stable connection between your site and the social Web.

= I'm posting to Facebook via Twitter. Isn't that the same thing? =

No. SharePress Pro provides you with the ability to customize message (status update) and the photo that appears on Facebook. Posting via Twitter does not provide this feature.

= When will SharePress support LinkedIn? =

Soon. SharePress 3.0 is nigh.

= When will SharePress support Google+? =

At this time it is not possible to publish to Google+ as Google does not offer a writable API. 

Other services and plugins support writing to Google+, but they do this by storing your Google account username and password, which is *extremely* dangerous.

= I'm having trouble. Where can I get support? =

Documentation and support for SharePress are available [here](http://getsharepress.com/setup).

E-mail based tech support is available to Pro customers. All you have to do is [buy a key](https://getsharepress.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=app-store&utm_campaign=get-support).

* Fixed: The bug introduced by 2.0.12 - everything was considered RPC because I forgot to treat the constant like a constant...

= 2.0.12 =
* Added: Support for posting to Facebook with SharePress via XML-RPC. You can't configure what the Facebook post will say -- it's all defaults. But it didn't work at all before. This is progress.

= 2.0.5 =
* Change: Renamed "Sharepress" to "SharePress"

= 1.0.9 =
* [Corey Brown](http://www.twitter.com/coreyweb) reported a bug in the "Publish to Facebook again" feature: not only was it not publishing again, but it was deleting the original meta data. This is now fixed.

= 1.0.8 =
* Ron Kochanowski reported a strange problem with brand new posts displaying the message "This post is older than the date on which SharePress was activated." in the editor. I couldn't fix the problem, so I eliminated the "feature." Problem solved.

= 1.0.7 =
* Added "sp" prefix to the Facebook classes, now "spFacebook" and "spSpFacebookApiException" - was creating namespace conflicts with other Facebook plugins (thanks [Ben Gillbanks](http://twitter.com/binarymoon) of [WPVOTE](http://www.wpvote.com))

= 1.0.6 =
* Addressing some inconsistencies in the way the plugin is named, and the way that name is used internally.
